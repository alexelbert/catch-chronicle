## Automated Testing

The logic of the most important features of the application have been tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

I only have one test passing, for rendering the navbar and that passes.

### Performed Tests

The following automated tests have been performed:

-Rendering of the navbar


## Manual Testing

- The website was manually tested on a variety of devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone) and browsers. The following browsers and operating systems have been tested:
  - Microsoft Windows: Microsoft Edge
  - iOS: Safari, Firefox, OperaGX

- The website is working as expected in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
- All links, buttons, and forms works as expected.
- Family members were asked to review the application to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

## Validators and Linter

### ES Lint

I used [ESlint](https://eslint.org) in my code editor [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it shows no errors.

### W3C Validators

The generated HTML passes the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) with no erros. The warnings about trailing slashes are due to the structure of the index.html file generated by Create React App and can be ignored:

![W3C Markup Validator Result](/docs/screenshots/w3e-html-valid.png)

Validating the generated CSS files with the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). It passes only with warnings about trailing slashes due to structure of the index.

![W3C CSS Validator Result](/docs/screenshots/css-validation-catch-chronicle.png)



### Lighthouse

[Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the deployed application. I generated reports for three sample pages with the following results:



Landing page, did not have the best performance due to image loading time.

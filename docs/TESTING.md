## Validators

### W3C Validators

The generated HTML passes the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) with no erros. The warnings about trailing slashes are due to the structure of the index.html file generated by Create React App and can be ignored:

Validating the generated CSS files with the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). It passes only with warnings about trailing slashes due to structure of the index.

## Automated Testing

The logic of the most important features of the application have been tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

I only have one test passing, for rendering the navbar and that passes.

### Performed Tests

The following automated tests have been performed:

-Rendering of the navbar


## Manual Testing

- The website was manually tested on a variety of devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone) and browsers. The following browsers and operating systems have been tested:
  - Microsoft Windows: Microsoft Edge
  - iOS: Safari, Firefox, OperaGX

- The website is working as expected in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
- All links, buttons, and forms works as expected.
- Family members were asked to review the application to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

## Validators and Linter

### ES Lint

I used [ESlint](https://eslint.org) in my code editor [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it shows no errors.

### W3C Validators

The generated HTML passes the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) with no erros. The warnings about trailing slashes are due to the structure of the index.html file generated by Create React App and can be ignored:

![W3C Markup Validator Result](/docs/screenshots/w3e-html-valid.png)

Validating the generated CSS files with the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). It passes only with warnings about trailing slashes due to structure of the index.

### Lighthouse

[Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the deployed application. I generated reports for three sample pages with the following results:



Landing page, did not have the best performance due to image loading time.

Add catch page:

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed responsiveness of the My Catches table, before fix on smaller screens you had to scroll horizontally. After fix table now shows vertically with separation between catches.


![Responsive Fix small screens](/docs/screenshots/responsive-fix-table.png)

- Warning in dev tools for CatchCreateForm/CatchEditForm:
Warning: `value` prop on `input` should not be null.

Fix: remove null values in postData and initialize all input field values to an empty string (`''`) in `useState` hook [Commit](https://github.com/alexelbert/catch-chronicle/commit/da057ee0f55f36ef814da122daecefa1e4d80749)

## Known Bugs

- During testing when deleting a catch the page froze and could not do anything before restarting the application. This only happened one time out of many tries across multiple different users.
- When editing a comment and click on the save button there is a bug where a gray outline appears around the container discovered late in testing phase so unfortunately remains unfixed.

- During testing when looking at the profile page in different screens there is a bug with the gear icon displaying in the way of the users location and the Catches, Followers, Following titles mash together slightly on the smallest mobile screens

## Known Limitations
- In the later stages of the project when fetching all catches for the chart and my catches table the loading time was really slow due to the default pagination setting in the backend. which caused multiple request before rendering. Found a quick fix where i increased the pagination from 10 to 15 (rendered the page about 0.5 seconds faster) tried 20 but that made the landing page too slow. [Commit](https://github.com/alexelbert/catch-chronicle-api/commit/5c7ecb91ad3318b8b8ff12dcf394bbe1c39e1caf) Future fix in the backend by defining pagination with at least two separate classes.
